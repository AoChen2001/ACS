# Quick Start

## Constructing a cluster sampling matrix

Simply input the number of factors k and the number of target elementary effects w in function "create_C" to construct the sampling matrix.

## Regarding the validation procedure

Input any sampling matrix into the function "validation_procedure" to obtain the number of elementary effects generated by the matrix for each factor.
