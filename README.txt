# ACS
This is the code for the ACS algorithm in the paper "Generating and Validating Cluster Sampling Matrices for Model-free Factor Screening"

# construct the sampling matrix
Simply input the number of factors k and the number of target elementary effects w in function "create_C" to construct the sampling matrix that meets the conditions.

# regarding the validation procedure
Input any sampling matrix into the function "validation_procedure" to obtain the number of elementary effects generated by the matrix for each factor.
